How to Build on Linux
=====================

### Building the latest "stable" version

Clone the repository openwebos/build-desktop and follow the instructions in the README file.

### Building your local clone

First follow the directions to build the latest "stable" version.

To build your local clone of WebAppMgr instead of the "stable" version installed with the build-webos-desktop script:

* Open the customize/location.sh script with a text editor
* Locate the line:  export WEBAPPMANAGER....
* Uncomment the line and change "${BASE}/webappmanager" to use the folder containing your clone, for example "${HOME}/github/webappmanager"
* Save your changes
* Remove the file ~/luna-desktop-binaries/webappmanager/luna-desktop-build*.stamp
* Start the build
